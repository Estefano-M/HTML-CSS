# HTML-CSS
HTML5 e CSS3 course from CursoemVideo by Gustavo Guanabara!

I'm learning how to create webpages and now i'm going to manage my repositories!

<a href="https://estefano-m.github.io/HTML-CSS//cap%C3%ADtulo-02/desafios/desafio-10.html" target="_blank" rel="next">Go to Android Project</a>

<a href="https://estefano-m.github.io/cordel-project/" target="_blank" rel="external">Go to Cordel Project inspired by Milton Duarte</a>

I just don't get it why even if i put the "target_blank" the webpage is being loaded in the same page and not opening a new webpage.

# Just doing some tests
